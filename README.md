## FAQ

#### Is there a limit?
Fatality.win forums limit your account to type a message every 5 seconds. I'd recomend to set a delay in the discord channel too.

#### Is thery any commands?

Currently, if you type in either discord or fatality shoutbox 
```bash
  /roll
```
the bot will simulate a dice roll, and you will get a number from 1 to 6.
